# Markdown
This is the project for the Markdown assignment

Here is the Readme file for this assignment.

Learning all of this information on how to use git is **amazing**

*Tyler Johnson's very own readme file filled with meaningless text.*

I could not think of any good websites to link so here is the Wiki page for Github
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub>


## This is the first of the two lists that are required for this assignment
* I'm just putting random things in this list
* I am enjoying this online class so far
* Github is actually more user friendly than I thought it would be.

#### This is for the second list
1. This is just some bulleted information for the second list
2. Hopefully all of this turns out okay
